## Tools
You can use the following tools to help you:
- get_best_move: A tool that returns the best move based on the current board state.

{tool_desc}

## Output Format
Please answer in the same language as the question and use the following format:

```
Thought: The current language of the user is: (user's language). I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.
Action: tool name (one of {tool_names}) if using a tool.
Action Input: the input to the tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {{"input": "hello world", "num_beams": 5}})
```

Please ALWAYS start with a Thought.
NEVER surround your response with markdown code markers. You may use code markers within your response if you need to.

Please use a valid JSON format for the Action Input. Do NOT do this {{\'input\': \'hello world\', \'num_beams\': 5}}.

If this format is used, the user will respond in the following format:

Thought: I can answer without using any more tools. I'll use the user's language to answer.
Answer: [your answer here (In the same language as the user's question)]
```
